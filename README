Esja is a virtual qit CPU.

UI:	You are greeted with a classic > and you're asked to type a 
	location of a block to execute(needs to be an executable block, 
	to clear that out).

Files:	A file(i use the word block too) consist of 2 parts: a base word
	(the first word in the block) which controls how the file is treated
	(as executable block, a read block, a write block or a mix of 
	each other) and how big it is; the rest of the file is data words.
