Esja is a virtual crumb computer.

Role models:
	The hardware(the part coded in C, esja.c for example) is based on 
	the IBM PC 8086/87 and the software(the part that is kept in esja.ehd;
	executable by exec()) is based on CP/M.

UI:	You are greeted with a classic > and you're asked to type a 
	location of a block to execute(needs to be an executable block, 
	to clear that out).

Files:	A file(i use the word block too) consist of 2 parts: a base word
	(the first word in the block) which controls how the file is treated
	(as executable block, a read block, a write block or a mix of 
	each other) and how big it is; the rest of the file is data words.
